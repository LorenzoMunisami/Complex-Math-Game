	
     1)	You will be given a quiz with 30 complex maths questions,
	a question may be addition, subtraction or multiplication
     2) Type in your answer for each question and press enter 
		eg) (3+1i)-(1-1i) = 2+2i
     3) For every question you answer right you will receive 100 points
     4) For every question you answer wrong you will lose 50 points
     5) But that's not all, there's also a catch. The time taken in 
	seconds to complete the quiz will be deducted from your final
	score where every second counts as 1 point. ie: If it takes you
	5 minutes to complete the quiz, you will lose 300 points.
     6) If there are two players, each player will have a turn to answer
	their questions. The results will show at the end.
     7) No player can obtain a perfect score, so remember SPEED and accuracy
	matter. Do your best and you might just make the top 10.

				 GOODLUCK!
